**Intervention and field characteristic machine-learned modeling**

[[International Publication Number: WO 2022/140201 A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2022140201A1/en?oq=WO+2022%2f140201+A1)]

Abstract: One or more fields can be divided into portions, and different sets of interventions can be performed during the course of planting and growing a crop in each field portion. The effect of each set of interventions on the crop outcome of the corresponding field portion can be determined using a best performing model of a set of predictive models applied to the set of interventions. The selected model can be used to determine an effect of each intervention on crop outcome of a field portion by estimating a portion of the crop outcome attributable to the intervention. A machine-learned model can be trained based on the effect each intervention has on crop outcome determined by the selected model, and the machine-learned model can be applied to subsequent fields and crops to predict effects that various interventions can have on subsequent crop outcomes.
