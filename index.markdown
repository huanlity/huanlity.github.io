## <span style="color:#CB4335">About Me</span>

I am a computational biologist/agronomist passionate about using data science and imaging data to translate biological and agronomic sciences into digital solutions that better understand, diagnose, and treat various tissue-based diseases or increase the sustainability and profitability of agricultural systems. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Agronomy from Kansas State University where I used optical sensors to assess and monitor crop and soil conditions.

**Computational Biologist** (2021 May - Current)\\
[Spatial Technology Platform](https://www.broadinstitute.org/spatial-technology-platform), [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), Cambridge, MA.\\
- Designed various pipelines to process and analyze highly multiplexed imagery data on the Google Cloud Platform.\\
- Led the effort on processing and analyzing CODEX/CyCIF/mIF/MERFISH/Xenium/CosMX data on multiple projects.\\
- Compared protein-based spatial biology methods across tissues.\\
- Conducted the systematic benchmarking of imaging spatial transcriptomics platforms in FFPE human samples across healthy and cancerous tissues.\\

**Data Scientist** (2018 March - 2021 Jan)\\
Geoinnovation, [Indigo Agriculture](https://www.indigoag.com), Charlestown, MA.\\
- Designed on-farm experiments to test the effect of beneficial microbes coated on the seeds on the grain yield of Corn, Soy, Cotton, and Rice.\\
- Applied traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques to derive insights from the data and made actionable recommendations to our consumers.\\
- Designed and implemented a pipeline for imagery data management (transfer, storing, logging, and quality control).\\
- Developed protocols for UAV imagery data collection implemented in10 states in the US and South America.
- Developed a pipeline to count individual corn plants, built an internal tool to direct soil sampling in farming fields, using Hi-Res RGB images.\\
- Built UAV imagery-based crop condition reports as an alert and scouting tool for farmers to do in-season crop management.\\
- Build modules within the “machine data factory” to clean all types of machine data automatically including as-planted, as-applied, and as-harvested data.\\

**Digital Agronomist (Intern)** (2017 March - 2017 Aug)\\
[The Climate Corporation](https://climate.com/), St Louis, MO.\\
- Characterized soil properties using high-definition bare soil aerial imagery including color infrared and thermal data.\\
- Evaluated the relationship between imagery-based soil features and in-season crop response on corn and soybean.\\
- Developed new indices for quantifying the sub-field temperature variation and a new method for creating management zones using bare soil imagery.\\
